# NiceGUI LocalHost Chat App

A simple **real-time chat application** built using **NiceGUI**, a Python web-based UI framework. This project lets you run a chat interface locally on your machine — accessible via your browser (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`). It demonstrates how to create interactive web apps in Python without writing HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

NiceGUI makes building GUIs easy by letting you write UI logic and layout in Python. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
